# 
injection of generic-type components (by type or by type+name):

no beans are found actually. In some case the errors are shown, in others just no navigation is available

Note that the case from `com.mytests.spring.springboundedgenericsinjection.generics.InjectMultiBoundGenericsListInConstructor`
is supported in Spring 6.2 only.

Other cases work in the previous Spring versions too.
